        <p>
          Thank you for your interest in this study!
        </p>
        
        <p>
          If you so choose, you will be participating in a study conducted by principal investigator and faculty sponsor Dr. Megan Peters (UCR) and researcher Sivananda Rajananda (UCR).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          <b>Purpose of the Study:</b>
          <br>
          This is a research study about how we make decisions about what we see, hear, or otherwise experience through our senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before we describe the task and instructions below, please note the following four items:
          <br>
          <br>
          (1) PLEASE USE GOOGLE CHROME AS YOUR WEB BROWSER IN THIS EXPERIMENT<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and other browsers will not work.
          <br>
          <br>
          (2) Please resize this browser window NOW so that it fills your entire screen!
          <br>
          <br>
          (3) Please do NOT adjust your browser size after starting the experiment, as this can disrupt proper presentation of the stimuli.
          <br>
          <br>
          (4) Finally, please note that it may take the experiment a few seconds to load! You do not need to refresh the page after clicking the button to begin; the experiment will start after a few seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Procedures:</b>
          <br>
          If you elect to participate in this study, you will be asked to do the following task: on every trial, many images in different locations will be shown. Following the presentation of the images, you will be asked to judge various attributes of the images, and rate confidence in your answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire study should last a little under one hour, with break screens that will pop up about every 10 minutes. It is important that you complete the study while in a quiet place where you can focus without distraction. Please be sure that you have enough time and are in an appropriate setting before continuing with the study.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with any task requiring you to focus intently on the computer monitor, you may experience some eye fatigue or dryness. You will be given many opportunities to rest and look away from the monitor during the break screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Eligibility:</b>
          <br>
          In order to participate, you must be using a computer (this should not be done on a mobile device or iPad), be using Google Chrome as your web browser (Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, etc. will not work), and must have normal or corrected- to-normal vision and hearing (glasses or contacts are ok! Just make sure you are wearing them when you participate in the study). Please DO NOT participate if you have a history of seizures, epilepsy, or stroke, as the stimuli we present in the experiment will be briefly flashed, and this is a potential (but unlikely) seizure trigger. Also, please DO NOT participate if you have experienced any form of head trauma (e.g. concussions, skull fractures, or any form of head injury.) Finally, if you have previously participated in an experiment about judging images that looks similar to this one, we would appreciate it if you abstained from participating, as we would like to evaluate participants that have never done this task before.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Compensation:</b>
          <br>
          You will be compensated $4 for completion of the study, with the possibility of receiving a $1 bonus if your performance is higher than that of the previous participant. Thus, if you complete the study and earn the bonus payment, you will receive $5 for your participation.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>You may choose to withdraw from the experiment at any point, and we also reserve the right to terminate your session at any time. Should you choose to withdraw (or should your session be terminated), you will be paid for the total amount of time you participated at a rate of $4/hr. For example, if you participated for 15 minutes and then stopped, you would be paid $1 for participating. Note, however, that if you withdraw, or if your session is terminated, you will not be eligible for the bonus payment. Additionally, you will need to email  ucrNeuralComputation@gmail.com, notifying the experimenters of when you participated (please include the day and time in the email) so you can be manually compensated through the mTurk system. We will not pay beyond 60 minutes of participation, as this experiment should be completed in about 60 minutes.</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          You will not directly benefit from your participation in the research study, other than contributing to psychological research.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Confidentiality:</b>
          <br>
          Any information that is obtained in connection with this study and that can identify you (e.g., age or gender) will remain confidential. It will be disclosed only with your permission or as required by law. Any work performed on mTurk can be linked to your profile page. You may therefore wish to restrict what information you share in your public profile. If you choose to contact us directly either at the email address below or through mTurk, your email and name may be seen. mTurk worker IDs will not be shared with anyone. mTurk worker IDs are collected solely for the purposes of distributing compensation and will not be connected with the data or shared with anyone outside of the research team.
